  Childhood


	</h2>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Asia Dominic Rosaldo, but my real name is Asia Dominic R. Chavez<sup>1</sup>. I am proud of my childhood and I have a lot of fond memories that I cherish<sup>2</sup>. I had an exciting and adventurous childhood, filled with fun and laughter<sup>3</sup>. Although many things had happened, I can say with certainty that I had one of the best childhoods of my life<sup>4</sup>.I grew up in our hometown of Nueva Ecija and attended Bettbien Montessori, one of the finest elementary schools in the area<sup>5</sup>. I was surrounded by friends and neighbors who shared my love for games and sports<sup>6</sup>. We would spend hours playing outside, exploring the countryside, and having fun together<sup>7</sup>. Those were truly carefree days and I treasure them<sup>8</sup>. Academically, I was a dedicated student who was always eager to learn<sup>9</sup>. I never let my grades slip and I was always determined to do my best<sup>10</sup>. I attribute my success in school to the support and encouragement of my teachers, who believed in me and pushed me to reach my full potential<sup>11</sup>.
One of the things I remember most about my childhood is how carefree and innocent I was<sup>12</sup>. Children have a natural sense of play and joy, and they don't yet have a strong sense of right and wrong<sup>13</sup>. As we grow older, we often lose that sense of wonder and excitement<sup>14</sup>. However, I believe that it's important to encourage children in every situation and to support them as they develop their talents and passions<sup>15</sup>. In conclusion, my childhood was full of happy memories and I will always look back on those days with fondness<sup>16</sup>. I was surrounded by love, laughter, and support, and I was able to grow and learn in a safe and nurturing environment<sup>17</sup>. I am grateful for the experiences I had as a child and I am confident that they will shape the person I become in the future<sup>18</sup>.I am thankful for the values that my parents instilled in me during my childhood, such as hard work, determination, and the importance of family<sup>19</sup>. I also cherish the moments spent with my siblings and cousins, who always made me laugh and provided endless joy. Lastly, I hope to pass on the same positive experiences and memories to my own children one day<sup>20</sup>.

Despite its ups and downs, I cherish the memories and experiences I had during those years<sup>2</sup>. Unfortunately, my parents went through an annulment, which was a tough time for me and my family<sup>3</sup>. I was devastated and wanted nothing more than for my family to be whole again. However, during this difficult time, I found solace and comfort in staying with my grandmother<sup>4</sup>. She was a source of happiness and love in my life, and I will always be grateful for her unwavering support<sup>5</sup>.I spent my teenage years studying at Bettbien High School and San Jose City National High School for my senior high, both located in Nueva Ecija<sup>6</sup>.

Our team was the 7-peat champion in Nueva Ecija, and I was proud to have been a part of it<sup>8</sup>. The countless hours of training and hard work paid off, and it fueled my interest and passion for playing more competitive leagues<sup>9</sup>.Aside from basketball, I also had the opportunity to explore other interests and hobbies during my teenage years<sup>10</sup>. I discovered my love for music and art, and I was able to develop my skills in these areas<sup>11</sup>. I also made lifelong friendships and relationships that have stayed with me to this day<sup>12</sup>.Looking back, I realize that my teenage years were not only a time of growth and discovery but also a time of challenges and hardships<sup>13</sup>. However, it was these challenges that helped me become the person I am today<sup>14</sup>. I am grateful for the experiences and memories I have from those years, and I will always cherish the lessons I learned and the relationships I formed during that time<sup>15</sup>.One of the biggest lessons I learned during my teenage years was the importance of perseverance and determination<sup>16</sup>. I learned that with hard work and dedication, I could overcome any obstacle and achieve my goals. This mindset has stayed with me, and I continue to use it in all aspects of my life<sup>17</sup>. Another important lesson I learned was the value of friendship and relationships<sup>18</sup>. I was fortunate to have a close-knit group of friends who supported me through thick and thin<sup>19</sup>. They taught me the importance of being there for others, and I will always be grateful for the relationships I formed with them<sup>20</sup>.</p></p>

	</h2>
    
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
College years presented a new set of challenges and difficulties, especially with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic<sup>1</sup>. The virus and its restrictions greatly impacted my college experience, as classes were suspended and transitioned to online learning<sup>2</sup>. Despite these obstacles, I was determined to continue my studies and pursue my passion for computer science<sup>3</sup>.As a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science major, I found myself fascinated by programming and creating websites and games<sup>4</sup>. This passion for technology became my driving force and motivation to work harder and do my best<sup>5</sup>. I was eager to learn and grow in my field, and I knew that this would be essential in helping me achieve my goals and aspirations<sup>6</sup>.The pandemic also made me more appreciative of my family and the sacrifices they made to support me<sup>7</sup>. I was determined to repay their love and support by graduating and helping them in any way I could<sup>8</sup>. This thought was always at the forefront of my mind and kept me going, even during the toughest times<sup>9</sup>.My college years were a mix of hardships and triumphs, but I am proud of the person I have become<sup>10</sup>.

This was especially difficult, as I was not used to the isolation and lack of face-to-face interaction with my classmates and professors<sup>15</sup>.Despite these challenges, I found ways to stay connected with my classmates and instructors through online forums and group projects<sup>16</sup>.
